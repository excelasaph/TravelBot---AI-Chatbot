"question: Could you write a brief overview of how these two towns in Bavaria, Oberammergau and Neuburg an der Donau, handled the plague in the 17th century and how their responses reflect their current cultural and economic conditions? answer:","In the 17th century, both Oberammergau and Neuburg an der Donau, towns in Bavaria, faced the devastating threat of the plague. Oberammergau, in response to the loss of life, vowed to stage the ""Jesus Christ Passion Play"" every decade, should the plague spare their community. This promise was honored, and miraculously, the plague subsided. The commitment to perform the Passion Play every decade not only kept alive a religious tradition but also transformed Oberammergau into a significant cultural and tourist attraction, with the town's economy benefiting substantially from the influx of visitors during the play years.

Conversely, Neuburg an der Donau, in the face of the plague threat in 1713, turned to St. Sebastian for protection, promising to erect a statue in his honor if spared. While the plague did not reach the town, the memory of the event and the statue have faded into obscurity over time. The town's failure to maintain a cultural tradition related to its plague history, unlike Oberammergau, has resulted in less tourism and economic activity centered around this historical event. Neuburg an der Donau relies on its scenic beauty and historical landmarks for tourism, but this does not generate the same level of economic benefit as Oberammergau's well-established and globally recognized Passion Play tradition. The contrast in how these towns have preserved and promoted their historical responses to the plague is reflected in their current cultural and economic conditions, with Oberammergau prospering as a tourist destination and Neuburg an der Donau's tourism industry and economy remaining less developed.","Oberammergau and Neuburg an der Donau, two towns in Bavaria, dealt with the plague in the 17th century in a way that reflects their current cultural and economic conditions.
